# Update Codemaps Prompt Recipe

## Codex invocation

Ask Codex to execute the `update-codemaps` workflow as a normal prompt. Provide the target files, repository context, constraints, and whether edits are allowed.

## Inputs

- Target files, folders, issue text, or feature request.
- Any constraints on edits, tests, external services, or output format.
- Explicit permission before actions with external side effects.

## Workflow

1. Read the relevant local files or pasted context.
2. Identify the smallest safe set of actions for the requested workflow.
3. Use dry-run or mock mode for external integrations unless real credentials and explicit permission are present.
4. Execute local, reversible steps first.
5. Report missing tools or credentials instead of blocking silently.

## Output format

Return a concise Codex response with:

- Summary of actions or findings.
- Files changed or reviewed.
- Validation commands and results.
- External dependency status, if any.
- Follow-up fixes required before real integration use.

## Safety / side effects

This recipe is a prompt workflow, not a native slash command. Do not assume Claude Code hooks, Claude-only slash commands, or Claude-only agent runtime are available. Do not perform network, posting, email, payment, or destructive file operations unless the user explicitly authorizes them and required credentials are configured.

## Historical Claude Code reference

The content below is retained as migration reference only. Slash-command examples are historical notes and are not Codex runtime requirements.

# Update Codemaps Prompt Recipe

This is a Codex prompt recipe, not a Claude slash command. In Codex, paste this file's body into the chat or ask: "Use the `update-codemaps` prompt recipe for <task>."

**Original command intent:** update codemaps. Use when Codex needs support for: update codemaps.

# Update Codemaps

Analyze the codebase structure and generate token-lean architecture documentation.

## Step 1: Scan Project Structure

1. Identify the project type (monorepo, single app, library, microservice)
2. Find all source directories (src/, lib/, app/, packages/)
3. Map entry points (main.ts, index.ts, app.py, main.go, etc.)

## Step 2: Generate Codemaps

Create or update codemaps in `docs/CODEMAPS/` (or `.reports/codemaps/`):

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `architecture.md` | High-level system diagram, service boundaries, data flow |
| `backend.md` | API routes, middleware chain, service → repository mapping |
| `frontend.md` | Page tree, component hierarchy, state management flow |
| `data.md` | Database tables, relationships, migration history |
| `dependencies.md` | External services, third-party integrations, shared libraries |

### Codemap Format

Each codemap should be token-lean — optimized for AI context consumption:

```markdown
# Backend Architecture

## Routes
POST /api/users → UserController.create → UserService.create → UserRepo.insert
GET  /api/users/:id → UserController.get → UserService.findById → UserRepo.findById

## Key Files
src/services/user.ts (business logic, 120 lines)
src/repos/user.ts (database access, 80 lines)

## Dependencies
- PostgreSQL (primary data store)
- Redis (session cache, rate limiting)
- Stripe (payment processing)
```

## Step 3: Diff Detection

1. If previous codemaps exist, calculate the diff percentage
2. If changes > 30%, show the diff and request user approval before overwriting
3. If changes <= 30%, update in place

## Step 4: Add Metadata

Add a freshness header to each codemap:

```markdown
<!-- Generated: 2026-02-11 | Files scanned: 142 | Token estimate: ~800 -->
```

## Step 5: Save Analysis Report

Write a summary to `.reports/codemap-diff.txt`:
- Files added/removed/modified since last scan
- New dependencies detected
- Architecture changes (new routes, new services, etc.)
- Staleness warnings for docs not updated in 90+ days

## Tips

- Focus on **high-level structure**, not implementation details
- Prefer **file paths and function signatures** over full code blocks
- Keep each codemap under **1000 tokens** for efficient context loading
- Use ASCII diagrams for data flow instead of verbose descriptions
- Run after major feature additions or refactoring sessions

# Code Review Prompt Recipe

## Codex invocation

Ask Codex to execute the `code-review` workflow as a normal prompt. Provide the target files, repository context, constraints, and whether edits are allowed.

## Inputs

- Target files, folders, issue text, or feature request.
- Any constraints on edits, tests, external services, or output format.
- Explicit permission before actions with external side effects.

## Workflow

1. Read the relevant local files or pasted context.
2. Identify the smallest safe set of actions for the requested workflow.
3. Use dry-run or mock mode for external integrations unless real credentials and explicit permission are present.
4. Execute local, reversible steps first.
5. Report missing tools or credentials instead of blocking silently.

## Output format

Return a concise Codex response with:

- Summary of actions or findings.
- Files changed or reviewed.
- Validation commands and results.
- External dependency status, if any.
- Follow-up fixes required before real integration use.

## Safety / side effects

This recipe is a prompt workflow, not a native slash command. Do not assume Claude Code hooks, Claude-only slash commands, or Claude-only agent runtime are available. Do not perform network, posting, email, payment, or destructive file operations unless the user explicitly authorizes them and required credentials are configured.

## Historical Claude Code reference

The content below is retained as migration reference only. Slash-command examples are historical notes and are not Codex runtime requirements.

# Code Review Prompt Recipe

This is a Codex prompt recipe, not a Claude slash command. In Codex, paste this file's body into the chat or ask: "Use the `code-review` prompt recipe for <task>."

**Original command intent:** Code review — local uncommitted changes or GitHub PR (pass PR number/URL for PR mode). Use when Codex needs support for: Code review — local uncommitted changes or GitHub PR (pass PR number/URL for PR mode).

# Code Review

> PR review mode adapted from PRPs-agentic-eng by Wirasm. Part of the PRP workflow series.

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Mode Selection

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a PR number, PR URL, or `--pr`:
→ Jump to **PR Review Mode** below.

Otherwise:
→ Use **Local Review Mode**.

---

## Local Review Mode

Comprehensive security and quality review of uncommitted changes.

### Phase 1 — GATHER

```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD
```

If no changed files, stop: "Nothing to review."

### Phase 2 — REVIEW

Read each changed file in full. Check for:

**Security Issues (CRITICAL):**
- Hardcoded credentials, API keys, tokens
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Missing input validation
- Insecure dependencies
- Path traversal risks

**Code Quality (HIGH):**
- Functions > 50 lines
- Files > 800 lines
- Nesting depth > 4 levels
- Missing error handling
- console.log statements
- TODO/FIXME comments
- Missing JSDoc for public APIs

**Best Practices (MEDIUM):**
- Mutation patterns (use immutable instead)
- Emoji usage in code/comments
- Missing tests for new code
- Accessibility issues (a11y)

### Phase 3 — REPORT

Generate report with:
- Severity: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
- File location and line numbers
- Issue description
- Suggested fix

Block commit if CRITICAL or HIGH issues found.
Never approve code with security vulnerabilities.

## PR Review Mode

Comprehensive GitHub PR review — fetches diff, reads full files, runs validation, posts review.

### Phase 1 — FETCH

Parse input to determine PR:

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| Number (e.g. `42`) | Use as PR number |
| URL (`github.com/.../pull/42`) | Extract PR number |
| Branch name | Find PR via `gh pr list --head <branch>` |

```bash
gh pr view <NUMBER> --json number,title,body,author,baseRefName,headRefName,changedFiles,additions,deletions
gh pr diff <NUMBER>
```

If PR not found, stop with error. Store PR metadata for later phases.

### Phase 2 — CONTEXT

Build review context:

1. **Project rules** — Read `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/docs/`, and any contributing guidelines
2. **PRP artifacts** — Check `.claude/PRPs/reports/` and `.claude/PRPsthe plan prompt recipes/` for implementation context related to this PR
3. **PR intent** — Parse PR description for goals, linked issues, test plans
4. **Changed files** — List all modified files and categorize by type (source, test, config, docs)

### Phase 3 — REVIEW

Read each changed file **in full** (not just the diff hunks — you need surrounding context).

For PR reviews, fetch the full file contents at the PR head revision:
```bash
gh pr diff <NUMBER> --name-only | while IFS= read -r file; do
  gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/$file?ref=<head-branch>" --jq '.content' | base64 -d
done
```

Apply the review checklist across 7 categories:

| Category | What to Check |
|---|---|
| **Correctness** | Logic errors, off-by-ones, null handling, edge cases, race conditions |
| **Type Safety** | Type mismatches, unsafe casts, `any` usage, missing generics |
| **Pattern Compliance** | Matches project conventions (naming, file structure, error handling, imports) |
| **Security** | Injection, auth gaps, secret exposure, SSRF, path traversal, XSS |
| **Performance** | N+1 queries, missing indexes, unbounded loops, memory leaks, large payloads |
| **Completeness** | Missing tests, missing error handling, incomplete migrations, missing docs |
| **Maintainability** | Dead code, magic numbers, deep nesting, unclear naming, missing types |

Assign severity to each finding:

| Severity | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **CRITICAL** | Security vulnerability or data loss risk | Must fix before merge |
| **HIGH** | Bug or logic error likely to cause issues | Should fix before merge |
| **MEDIUM** | Code quality issue or missing best practice | Fix recommended |
| **LOW** | Style nit or minor suggestion | Optional |

### Phase 4 — VALIDATE

Run available validation commands:

Detect the project type from config files (`package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.), then run the appropriate commands:

**Node.js / TypeScript** (has `package.json`):
```bash
npm run typecheck 2>/dev/null || npx tsc --noEmit 2>/dev/null  # Type check
npm run lint                                                    # Lint
npm test                                                        # Tests
npm run build                                                   # Build
```

**Rust** (has `Cargo.toml`):
```bash
cargo clippy -- -D warnings  # Lint
cargo test                   # Tests
cargo build                  # Build
```

**Go** (has `go.mod`):
```bash
go vet ./...    # Lint
go test ./...   # Tests
go build ./...  # Build
```

**Python** (has `pyproject.toml` / `setup.py`):
```bash
pytest  # Tests
```

Run only the commands that apply to the detected project type. Record pass/fail for each.

### Phase 5 — DECIDE

Form recommendation based on findings:

| Condition | Decision |
|---|---|
| Zero CRITICAL/HIGH issues, validation passes | **APPROVE** |
| Only MEDIUM/LOW issues, validation passes | **APPROVE** with comments |
| Any HIGH issues or validation failures | **REQUEST CHANGES** |
| Any CRITICAL issues | **BLOCK** — must fix before merge |

Special cases:
- Draft PR → Always use **COMMENT** (not approve/block)
- Only docs/config changes → Lighter review, focus on correctness
- Explicit `--approve` or `--request-changes` flag → Override decision (but still report all findings)

### Phase 6 — REPORT

Create review artifact at `.claude/PRPs/reviews/pr-<NUMBER>-review.md`:

```markdown
# PR Review: #<NUMBER> — <TITLE>

**Reviewed**: <date>
**Author**: <author>
**Branch**: <head> → <base>
**Decision**: APPROVE | REQUEST CHANGES | BLOCK

## Summary
<1-2 sentence overall assessment>

## Findings

### CRITICAL
<findings or "None">

### HIGH
<findings or "None">

### MEDIUM
<findings or "None">

### LOW
<findings or "None">

## Validation Results

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Type check | Pass / Fail / Skipped |
| Lint | Pass / Fail / Skipped |
| Tests | Pass / Fail / Skipped |
| Build | Pass / Fail / Skipped |

## Files Reviewed
<list of files with change type: Added/Modified/Deleted>
```

### Phase 7 — PUBLISH

Post the review to GitHub:

```bash
# If APPROVE
gh pr review <NUMBER> --approve --body "<summary of review>"

# If REQUEST CHANGES
gh pr review <NUMBER> --request-changes --body "<summary with required fixes>"

# If COMMENT only (draft PR or informational)
gh pr review <NUMBER> --comment --body "<summary>"
```

For inline comments on specific lines, use the GitHub review comments API:
```bash
gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<NUMBER>/comments" \
  -f body="<comment>" \
  -f path="<file>" \
  -F line=<line-number> \
  -f side="RIGHT" \
  -f commit_id="$(gh pr view <NUMBER> --json headRefOid --jq .headRefOid)"
```

Alternatively, post a single review with multiple inline comments at once:
```bash
gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<NUMBER>/reviews" \
  -f event="COMMENT" \
  -f body="<overall summary>" \
  --input comments.json  # [{"path": "file", "line": N, "body": "comment"}, ...]
```

### Phase 8 — OUTPUT

Report to user:

```
PR #<NUMBER>: <TITLE>
Decision: <APPROVE|REQUEST_CHANGES|BLOCK>

Issues: <critical_count> critical, <high_count> high, <medium_count> medium, <low_count> low
Validation: <pass_count>/<total_count> checks passed

Artifacts:
  Review: .claude/PRPs/reviews/pr-<NUMBER>-review.md
  GitHub: <PR URL>

Next steps:
  - <contextual suggestions based on decision>
```

---

## Edge Cases

- **No `gh` CLI**: Fall back to local-only review (read the diff, skip GitHub publish). Warn user.
- **Diverged branches**: Suggest `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/<base>` before review.
- **Large PRs (>50 files)**: Warn about review scope. Focus on source changes first, then tests, then config/docs.

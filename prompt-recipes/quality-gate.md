# Quality Gate Prompt Recipe

## Codex invocation

Ask Codex to execute the `quality-gate` workflow as a normal prompt. Provide the target files, repository context, constraints, and whether edits are allowed.

## Inputs

- Target files, folders, issue text, or feature request.
- Any constraints on edits, tests, external services, or output format.
- Explicit permission before actions with external side effects.

## Workflow

1. Read the relevant local files or pasted context.
2. Identify the smallest safe set of actions for the requested workflow.
3. Use dry-run or mock mode for external integrations unless real credentials and explicit permission are present.
4. Execute local, reversible steps first.
5. Report missing tools or credentials instead of blocking silently.

## Output format

Return a concise Codex response with:

- Summary of actions or findings.
- Files changed or reviewed.
- Validation commands and results.
- External dependency status, if any.
- Follow-up fixes required before real integration use.

## Safety / side effects

This recipe is a prompt workflow, not a native slash command. Do not assume Claude Code hooks, Claude-only slash commands, or Claude-only agent runtime are available. Do not perform network, posting, email, payment, or destructive file operations unless the user explicitly authorizes them and required credentials are configured.

**Original command intent:** quality gate. Use when Codex needs support for: quality gate.

# Quality Gate Command

Run the ECC quality pipeline on demand for a file or project scope.

# Build Fix Prompt Recipe

## Codex invocation

Ask Codex to execute the `build-fix` workflow as a normal prompt. Provide the target files, repository context, constraints, and whether edits are allowed.

## Inputs

- Target files, folders, issue text, or feature request.
- Any constraints on edits, tests, external services, or output format.
- Explicit permission before actions with external side effects.

## Workflow

1. Read the relevant local files or pasted context.
2. Identify the smallest safe set of actions for the requested workflow.
3. Use dry-run or mock mode for external integrations unless real credentials and explicit permission are present.
4. Execute local, reversible steps first.
5. Report missing tools or credentials instead of blocking silently.

## Output format

Return a concise Codex response with:

- Summary of actions or findings.
- Files changed or reviewed.
- Validation commands and results.
- External dependency status, if any.
- Follow-up fixes required before real integration use.

## Safety / side effects

This recipe is a prompt workflow, not a native slash command. Do not assume Claude Code hooks, Claude-only slash commands, or Claude-only agent runtime are available. Do not perform network, posting, email, payment, or destructive file operations unless the user explicitly authorizes them and required credentials are configured.

# Build Fix Prompt Recipe

This is a Codex prompt recipe, not a Claude slash command. In Codex, paste this file's body into the chat or ask: "Use the `build-fix` prompt recipe for <task>."

**Original command intent:** build fix. Use when Codex needs support for: build fix.

# Build and Fix

Incrementally fix build and type errors with minimal, safe changes.

## Step 1: Detect Build System

Identify the project's build tool and run the build:

| Indicator | Build Command |
|-----------|---------------|
| `package.json` with `build` script | `npm run build` or `pnpm build` |
| `tsconfig.json` (TypeScript only) | `npx tsc --noEmit` |
| `Cargo.toml` | `cargo build 2>&1` |
| `pom.xml` | `mvn compile` |
| `build.gradle` | `./gradlew compileJava` |
| `go.mod` | `go build ./...` |
| `pyproject.toml` | `python -m compileall -q .` or `mypy .` |

## Step 2: Parse and Group Errors

1. Run the build command and capture stderr
2. Group errors by file path
3. Sort by dependency order (fix imports/types before logic errors)
4. Count total errors for progress tracking

## Step 3: Fix Loop (One Error at a Time)

For each error:

1. **Read the file** — Use Read tool to see error context (10 lines around the error)
2. **Diagnose** — Identify root cause (missing import, wrong type, syntax error)
3. **Fix minimally** — Use Edit tool for the smallest change that resolves the error
4. **Re-run build** — Verify the error is gone and no new errors introduced
5. **Move to next** — Continue with remaining errors

## Step 4: Guardrails

Stop and ask the user if:
- A fix introduces **more errors than it resolves**
- The **same error persists after 3 attempts** (likely a deeper issue)
- The fix requires **architectural changes** (not just a build fix)
- Build errors stem from **missing dependencies** (need `npm install`, `cargo add`, etc.)

## Step 5: Summary

Show results:
- Errors fixed (with file paths)
- Errors remaining (if any)
- New errors introduced (should be zero)
- Suggested next steps for unresolved issues

## Recovery Strategies

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Missing module/import | Check if package is installed; suggest install command |
| Type mismatch | Read both type definitions; fix the narrower type |
| Circular dependency | Identify cycle with import graph; suggest extraction |
| Version conflict | Check `package.json` / `Cargo.toml` for version constraints |
| Build tool misconfiguration | Read config file; compare with working defaults |

Fix one error at a time for safety. Prefer minimal diffs over refactoring.

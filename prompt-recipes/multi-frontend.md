# Multi Frontend Prompt Recipe

## Codex invocation

Ask Codex to execute the `multi-frontend` workflow as a normal prompt. Provide the target files, repository context, constraints, and whether edits are allowed.

## Inputs

- Target files, folders, issue text, or feature request.
- Any constraints on edits, tests, external services, or output format.
- Explicit permission before actions with external side effects.

## Workflow

1. Read the relevant local files or pasted context.
2. Identify the smallest safe set of actions for the requested workflow.
3. Use dry-run or mock mode for external integrations unless real credentials and explicit permission are present.
4. Execute local, reversible steps first.
5. Report missing tools or credentials instead of blocking silently.

## Output format

Return a concise Codex response with:

- Summary of actions or findings.
- Files changed or reviewed.
- Validation commands and results.
- External dependency status, if any.
- Follow-up fixes required before real integration use.

## Safety / side effects

This recipe is a prompt workflow, not a native slash command. Do not assume Claude Code hooks, Claude-only slash commands, or Claude-only agent runtime are available. Do not perform network, posting, email, payment, or destructive file operations unless the user explicitly authorizes them and required credentials are configured.

# Multi Frontend Prompt Recipe

This is a Codex prompt recipe, not a Claude slash command. In Codex, paste this file's body into the chat or ask: "Use the `multi-frontend` prompt recipe for <task>."

**Original command intent:** multi frontend. Use when Codex needs support for: multi frontend.

# Frontend - Frontend-Focused Development

Frontend-focused workflow (Research → Ideation → Plan → Execute → Optimize → Review), Gemini-led.

## Usage

```bash
Codex prompt recipe equivalent: ask Codex to execute the `frontend` workflow with arguments `<UI task description>`.
```

## Context

- Frontend task: $ARGUMENTS
- Gemini-led, Codex for auxiliary reference
- Applicable: Component design, responsive layout, UI animations, style optimization

## Your Role

You are the **Frontend Orchestrator**, coordinating multi-model collaboration for UI/UX tasks (Research → Ideation → Plan → Execute → Optimize → Review).

**Collaborative Models**:
- **Gemini** – Frontend UI/UX (**Frontend authority, trustworthy**)
- **Codex** – Backend perspective (**Frontend opinions for reference only**)
- **Claude (self)** – Orchestration, planning, execution, delivery

## Multi-Model Call Specification

**Call Syntax**:

```
# New session call
Bash({
  command: "~/.claude/bin/codeagent-wrapper {{LITE_MODE_FLAG}}--backend gemini --gemini-model gemini-3-pro-preview - \"$PWD\" <<'EOF'
ROLE_FILE: <role prompt path>
<TASK>
Requirement: <enhanced requirement (or $ARGUMENTS if not enhanced)>
Context: <project context and analysis from previous phases>
</TASK>
OUTPUT: Expected output format
EOF",
  run_in_background: false,
  timeout: 3600000,
  description: "Brief description"
})

# Resume session call
Bash({
  command: "~/.claude/bin/codeagent-wrapper {{LITE_MODE_FLAG}}--backend gemini --gemini-model gemini-3-pro-preview resume <SESSION_ID> - \"$PWD\" <<'EOF'
ROLE_FILE: <role prompt path>
<TASK>
Requirement: <enhanced requirement (or $ARGUMENTS if not enhanced)>
Context: <project context and analysis from previous phases>
</TASK>
OUTPUT: Expected output format
EOF",
  run_in_background: false,
  timeout: 3600000,
  description: "Brief description"
})
```

**Role Prompts**:

| Phase | Gemini |
|-------|--------|
| Analysis | `~/.claude/.ccg/prompts/gemini/analyzer.md` |
| Planning | `~/.claude/.ccg/prompts/gemini/architect.md` |
| Review | `~/.claude/.ccg/prompts/gemini/reviewer.md` |

**Session Reuse**: Each call returns `SESSION_ID: xxx`, use `resume xxx` for subsequent phases. Save `GEMINI_SESSION` in Phase 2, use `resume` in Phases 3 and 5.

---

## Communication Guidelines

1. Start responses with mode label `[Mode: X]`, initial is `[Mode: Research]`
2. Follow strict sequence: `Research → Ideation → Plan → Execute → Optimize → Review`
3. Use `AskUserQuestion` tool for user interaction when needed (e.g., confirmation/selection/approval)

---

## Core Workflow

### Phase 0: Prompt Enhancement (Optional)

`[Mode: Prepare]` - If ace-tool MCP available, call `mcp__ace-tool__enhance_prompt`, **replace original $ARGUMENTS with enhanced result for subsequent Gemini calls**. If unavailable, use `$ARGUMENTS` as-is.

### Phase 1: Research

`[Mode: Research]` - Understand requirements and gather context

1. **Code Retrieval** (if ace-tool MCP available): Call `mcp__ace-tool__search_context` to retrieve existing components, styles, design system. If unavailable, use built-in tools: `Glob` for file discovery, `Grep` for component/style search, `Read` for context gathering, `Task` (Explore agent) for deeper exploration.
2. Requirement completeness score (0-10): >=7 continue, <7 stop and supplement

### Phase 2: Ideation

`[Mode: Ideation]` - Gemini-led analysis

**MUST call Gemini** (follow call specification above):
- ROLE_FILE: `~/.claude/.ccg/prompts/gemini/analyzer.md`
- Requirement: Enhanced requirement (or $ARGUMENTS if not enhanced)
- Context: Project context from Phase 1
- OUTPUT: UI feasibility analysis, recommended solutions (at least 2), UX evaluation

**Save SESSION_ID** (`GEMINI_SESSION`) for subsequent phase reuse.

Output solutions (at least 2), wait for user selection.

### Phase 3: Planning

`[Mode: Plan]` - Gemini-led planning

**MUST call Gemini** (use `resume <GEMINI_SESSION>` to reuse session):
- ROLE_FILE: `~/.claude/.ccg/prompts/gemini/architect.md`
- Requirement: User's selected solution
- Context: Analysis results from Phase 2
- OUTPUT: Component structure, UI flow, styling approach

Claude synthesizes plan, save to `.claudethe plan prompt recipe/task-name.md` after user approval.

### Phase 4: Implementation

`[Mode: Execute]` - Code development

- Strictly follow approved plan
- Follow existing project design system and code standards
- Ensure responsiveness, accessibility

### Phase 5: Optimization

`[Mode: Optimize]` - Gemini-led review

**MUST call Gemini** (follow call specification above):
- ROLE_FILE: `~/.claude/.ccg/prompts/gemini/reviewer.md`
- Requirement: Review the following frontend code changes
- Context: git diff or code content
- OUTPUT: Accessibility, responsiveness, performance, design consistency issues list

Integrate review feedback, execute optimization after user confirmation.

### Phase 6: Quality Review

`[Mode: Review]` - Final evaluation

- Check completion against plan
- Verify responsiveness and accessibility
- Report issues and recommendations

## Key Rules

1. **Gemini frontend opinions are trustworthy**
2. **Codex frontend opinions for reference only**
3. External models have **zero filesystem write access**
4. Claude handles all code writes and file operations

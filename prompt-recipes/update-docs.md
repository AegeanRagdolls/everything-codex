# Update Docs Prompt Recipe

## Codex invocation

Ask Codex to execute the `update-docs` workflow as a normal prompt. Provide the target files, repository context, constraints, and whether edits are allowed.

## Inputs

- Target files, folders, issue text, or feature request.
- Any constraints on edits, tests, external services, or output format.
- Explicit permission before actions with external side effects.

## Workflow

1. Read the relevant local files or pasted context.
2. Identify the smallest safe set of actions for the requested workflow.
3. Use dry-run or mock mode for external integrations unless real credentials and explicit permission are present.
4. Execute local, reversible steps first.
5. Report missing tools or credentials instead of blocking silently.

## Output format

Return a concise Codex response with:

- Summary of actions or findings.
- Files changed or reviewed.
- Validation commands and results.
- External dependency status, if any.
- Follow-up fixes required before real integration use.

## Safety / side effects

This recipe is a prompt workflow, not a native slash command. Do not assume Claude Code hooks, Claude-only slash commands, or Claude-only agent runtime are available. Do not perform network, posting, email, payment, or destructive file operations unless the user explicitly authorizes them and required credentials are configured.

## Historical Claude Code reference

The content below is retained as migration reference only. Slash-command examples are historical notes and are not Codex runtime requirements.

# Update Docs Prompt Recipe

This is a Codex prompt recipe, not a Claude slash command. In Codex, paste this file's body into the chat or ask: "Use the `update-docs` prompt recipe for <task>."

**Original command intent:** update docs. Use when Codex needs support for: update docs.

# Update Documentation

Sync documentation with the codebase, generating from source-of-truth files.

## Step 1: Identify Sources of Truth

| Source | Generates |
|--------|-----------|
| `package.json` scripts | Available commands reference |
| `.env.example` | Environment variable documentation |
| `openapi.yaml` / route files | API endpoint reference |
| Source code exports | Public API documentation |
| `Dockerfile` / `docker-compose.yml` | Infrastructure setup docs |

## Step 2: Generate Script Reference

1. Read `package.json` (or `Makefile`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`)
2. Extract all scripts/commands with their descriptions
3. Generate a reference table:

```markdown
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start development server with hot reload |
| `npm run build` | Production build with type checking |
| `npm test` | Run test suite with coverage |
```

## Step 3: Generate Environment Documentation

1. Read `.env.example` (or `.env.template`, `.env.sample`)
2. Extract all variables with their purposes
3. Categorize as required vs optional
4. Document expected format and valid values

```markdown
| Variable | Required | Description | Example |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | PostgreSQL connection string | `postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | No | Logging verbosity (default: info) | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |
```

## Step 4: Update Contributing Guide

Generate or update `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` with:
- Development environment setup (prerequisites, install steps)
- Available scripts and their purposes
- Testing procedures (how to run, how to write new tests)
- Code style enforcement (linter, formatter, pre-commit hooks)
- PR submission checklist

## Step 5: Update Runbook

Generate or update `docs/RUNBOOK.md` with:
- Deployment procedures (step-by-step)
- Health check endpoints and monitoring
- Common issues and their fixes
- Rollback procedures
- Alerting and escalation paths

## Step 6: Staleness Check

1. Find documentation files not modified in 90+ days
2. Cross-reference with recent source code changes
3. Flag potentially outdated docs for manual review

## Step 7: Show Summary

```
Documentation Update
──────────────────────────────
Updated:  docs/CONTRIBUTING.md (scripts table)
Updated:  docs/ENV.md (3 new variables)
Flagged:  docs/DEPLOY.md (142 days stale)
Skipped:  docs/API.md (no changes detected)
──────────────────────────────
```

## Rules

- **Single source of truth**: Always generate from code, never manually edit generated sections
- **Preserve manual sections**: Only update generated sections; leave hand-written prose intact
- **Mark generated content**: Use `<!-- AUTO-GENERATED -->` markers around generated sections
- **Don't create docs unprompted**: Only create new doc files if the command explicitly requests it

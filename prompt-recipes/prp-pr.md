# Prp Pr Prompt Recipe

## Codex invocation

Ask Codex to execute the `prp-pr` workflow as a normal prompt. Provide the target files, repository context, constraints, and whether edits are allowed.

## Inputs

- Target files, folders, issue text, or feature request.
- Any constraints on edits, tests, external services, or output format.
- Explicit permission before actions with external side effects.

## Workflow

1. Read the relevant local files or pasted context.
2. Identify the smallest safe set of actions for the requested workflow.
3. Use dry-run or mock mode for external integrations unless real credentials and explicit permission are present.
4. Execute local, reversible steps first.
5. Report missing tools or credentials instead of blocking silently.

## Output format

Return a concise Codex response with:

- Summary of actions or findings.
- Files changed or reviewed.
- Validation commands and results.
- External dependency status, if any.
- Follow-up fixes required before real integration use.

## Safety / side effects

This recipe is a prompt workflow, not a native slash command. Do not assume Claude Code hooks, Claude-only slash commands, or Claude-only agent runtime are available. Do not perform network, posting, email, payment, or destructive file operations unless the user explicitly authorizes them and required credentials are configured.

## Historical Claude Code reference

The content below is retained as migration reference only. Slash-command examples are historical notes and are not Codex runtime requirements.

# Prp Pr Prompt Recipe

This is a Codex prompt recipe, not a Claude slash command. In Codex, paste this file's body into the chat or ask: "Use the `prp-pr` prompt recipe for <task>."

**Original command intent:** Create a GitHub PR from current branch with unpushed commits — discovers templates, analyzes changes, pushes. Use when Codex needs support for: Create a GitHub PR from current branch with unpushed commits — discovers templates, analyzes changes, pushes.

# Create Pull Request

> Adapted from PRPs-agentic-eng by Wirasm. Part of the PRP workflow series.

**Input**: `$ARGUMENTS` — optional, may contain a base branch name and/or flags (e.g., `--draft`).

**Parse `$ARGUMENTS`**:
- Extract any recognized flags (`--draft`)
- Treat remaining non-flag text as the base branch name
- Default base branch to `main` if none specified

---

## Phase 1 — VALIDATE

Check preconditions:

```bash
git branch --show-current
git status --short
git log origin/<base>..HEAD --oneline
```

| Check | Condition | Action if Failed |
|---|---|---|
| Not on base branch | Current branch ≠ base | Stop: "Switch to a feature branch first." |
| Clean working directory | No uncommitted changes | Warn: "You have uncommitted changes. Commit or stash first. use the Codex prompt recipe equivalent for `prp-commit` to commit." |
| Has commits ahead | `git log origin/<base>..HEAD` not empty | Stop: "No commits ahead of `<base>`. Nothing to PR." |
| No existing PR | `gh pr list --head <branch> --json number` is empty | Stop: "PR already exists: #<number>. Use `gh pr view <number> --web` to open it." |

If all checks pass, proceed.

## Phase 2 — DISCOVER

### PR Template

Search for PR template in order:

1. `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/` directory — if exists, list files and let user choose (or use `default.md`)
2. `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
3. `.github/pull_request_template.md`
4. `docs/pull_request_template.md`

If found, read it and use its structure for the PR body.

### Commit Analysis

```bash
git log origin/<base>..HEAD --format="%h %s" --reverse
```

Analyze commits to determine:
- **PR title**: Use conventional commit format with type prefix — `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, etc.
  - If multiple types, use the dominant one
  - If single commit, use its message as-is
- **Change summary**: Group commits by type/area

### File Analysis

```bash
git diff origin/<base>..HEAD --stat
git diff origin/<base>..HEAD --name-only
```

Categorize changed files: source, tests, docs, config, migrations.

### PRP Artifacts

Check for related PRP artifacts:
- `.claude/PRPs/reports/` — Implementation reports
- `.claude/PRPsthe plan prompt recipes/` — Plans that were executed
- `.claude/PRPs/prds/` — Related PRDs

Reference these in the PR body if they exist.

---

## Phase 3 — PUSH

```bash
git push -u origin HEAD
```

If push fails due to divergence:
```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/<base>
git push -u origin HEAD
```

If rebase conflicts occur, stop and inform the user.

---

## Phase 4 — CREATE

### With Template

If a PR template was found in Phase 2, fill in each section using the commit and file analysis. Preserve all template sections — leave sections as "N/A" if not applicable rather than removing them.

### Without Template

Use this default format:

```markdown
## Summary

<1-2 sentence description of what this PR does and why>

## Changes

<bulleted list of changes grouped by area>

## Files Changed

<table or list of changed files with change type: Added/Modified/Deleted>

## Testing

<description of how changes were tested, or "Needs testing">

## Related Issues

<linked issues with Closes/Fixes/Relates to #N, or "None">
```

### Create the PR

```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "<PR title>" \
  --base <base-branch> \
  --body "<PR body>"
  # Add --draft if the --draft flag was parsed from $ARGUMENTS
```

---

## Phase 5 — VERIFY

```bash
gh pr view --json number,url,title,state,baseRefName,headRefName,additions,deletions,changedFiles
gh pr checks --json name,status,conclusion 2>/dev/null || true
```

---

## Phase 6 — OUTPUT

Report to user:

```
PR #<number>: <title>
URL: <url>
Branch: <head> → <base>
Changes: +<additions> -<deletions> across <changedFiles> files

CI Checks: <status summary or "pending" or "none configured">

Artifacts referenced:
  - <any PRP reportsthe plan prompt recipes linked in PR body>

Next steps:
  - gh pr view <number> --web   → open in browser
  - /code-review <number>       → review the PR
  - gh pr merge <number>        → merge when ready
```

---

## Edge Cases

- **No `gh` CLI**: Stop with: "GitHub CLI (`gh`) is required. Install: <https://cli.github.com/>"
- **Not authenticated**: Stop with: "Run `gh auth login` first."
- **Force push needed**: If remote has diverged and rebase was done, use `git push --force-with-lease` (never `--force`).
- **Multiple PR templates**: If `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/` has multiple files, list them and ask user to choose.
- **Large PR (>20 files)**: Warn about PR size. Suggest splitting if changes are logically separable.

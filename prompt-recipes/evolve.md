# Evolve Prompt Recipe

## Codex invocation

Ask Codex to execute the `evolve` workflow as a normal prompt. Provide the target files, repository context, constraints, and whether edits are allowed.

## Inputs

- Target files, folders, issue text, or feature request.
- Any constraints on edits, tests, external services, or output format.
- Explicit permission before actions with external side effects.

## Workflow

1. Read the relevant local files or pasted context.
2. Identify the smallest safe set of actions for the requested workflow.
3. Use dry-run or mock mode for external integrations unless real credentials and explicit permission are present.
4. Execute local, reversible steps first.
5. Report missing tools or credentials instead of blocking silently.

## Output format

Return a concise Codex response with:

- Summary of actions or findings.
- Files changed or reviewed.
- Validation commands and results.
- External dependency status, if any.
- Follow-up fixes required before real integration use.

## Safety / side effects

This recipe is a prompt workflow, not a native slash command. Do not assume Claude Code hooks, Claude-only slash commands, or Claude-only agent runtime are available. Do not perform network, posting, email, payment, or destructive file operations unless the user explicitly authorizes them and required credentials are configured.

## Historical Claude Code reference

The content below is retained as migration reference only. Slash-command examples are historical notes and are not Codex runtime requirements.

# Evolve Prompt Recipe

This is a Codex prompt recipe, not a Claude slash command. In Codex, paste this file's body into the chat or ask: "Use the `evolve` prompt recipe for <task>."

**Original command intent:** Analyze instincts and suggest or generate evolved structures. Use when Codex needs support for: Analyze instincts and suggest or generate evolved structures.

# Evolve Command

## Implementation

Run the instinct CLI using the plugin root path:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/continuous-learning-v2/scripts/instinct-cli.py" evolve [--generate]
```

Or if `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is not set (manual installation):

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/continuous-learning-v2/scripts/instinct-cli.py evolve [--generate]
```

Analyzes instincts and clusters related ones into higher-level structures:
- **Commands**: When instincts describe user-invoked actions
- **Skills**: When instincts describe auto-triggered behaviors
- **Agents**: When instincts describe complex, multi-step processes

## Usage

```
Codex prompt recipe equivalent: ask Codex to execute the `evolve` workflow with arguments `# Analyze all instincts and suggest evolutions`.
Codex prompt recipe equivalent: ask Codex to execute the `evolve` workflow with arguments `--generate         # Also generate files under evolved/{skills,commands,agents}`.
```

## Evolution Rules

### → Command (User-Invoked)
When instincts describe actions a user would explicitly request:
- Multiple instincts about "when user asks to..."
- Instincts with triggers like "when creating a new X"
- Instincts that follow a repeatable sequence

Example:
- `new-table-step1`: "when adding a database table, create migration"
- `new-table-step2`: "when adding a database table, update schema"
- `new-table-step3`: "when adding a database table, regenerate types"

→ Creates: **new-table** command

### → Skill (Auto-Triggered)
When instincts describe behaviors that should happen automatically:
- Pattern-matching triggers
- Error handling responses
- Code style enforcement

Example:
- `prefer-functional`: "when writing functions, prefer functional style"
- `use-immutable`: "when modifying state, use immutable patterns"
- `avoid-classes`: "when designing modules, avoid class-based design"

→ Creates: `functional-patterns` skill

### → Agent (Needs Depth/Isolation)
When instincts describe complex, multi-step processes that benefit from isolation:
- Debugging workflows
- Refactoring sequences
- Research tasks

Example:
- `debug-step1`: "when debugging, first check logs"
- `debug-step2`: "when debugging, isolate the failing component"
- `debug-step3`: "when debugging, create minimal reproduction"
- `debug-step4`: "when debugging, verify fix with test"

→ Creates: **debugger** agent

## What to Do

1. Detect current project context
2. Read project + global instincts (project takes precedence on ID conflicts)
3. Group instincts by trigger/domain patterns
4. Identify:
   - Skill candidates (trigger clusters with 2+ instincts)
   - Command candidates (high-confidence workflow instincts)
   - Agent candidates (larger, high-confidence clusters)
5. Show promotion candidates (project -> global) when applicable
6. If `--generate` is passed, write files to:
   - Project scope: `~/.claude/homunculus/projects/<project-id>/evolved/`
   - Global fallback: `~/.claude/homunculus/evolved/`
